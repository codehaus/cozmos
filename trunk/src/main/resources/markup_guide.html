<h3>Character style</h3>
Use any standard editor features:<br><br>
<table>
    <tr><th>Function</th><th>Windows Key</th><th>Mac OS X Key</th></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Bold</b></td><td>Ctrl-B</td><td>Apple-B</td></tr>
    <tr><td><i>Italics</i></td><td>Ctrl-I</td><td>Apple-I</td></tr>
    <tr><td><u>Underline</u></td><td>Ctrl-U</td><td>Apple-U</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Links to other pages</h3>
Links are easy - just put them inside square brackets [~like so] and they become full links [like so] after editing,
and when presented for the browser.<br>
If the page does not exist at the outset, Cozmos will give you a chance to add a page.
It does this by shwoing a standard template instead of showing a "page not found" error in the browser.<br>
<br>
Spaces in wiki style links will be turned into underscores ('_') automatically in the resulting file name.
Click on the left (to the left) to see the link transformed.<br>
<br>
Hierachical directories are easy too. Something like [~test/an example] becomes [test/an example] after editing.
This example suggesting there is a file calles 'an_example.html' inside a folder called 'test'. You can group you
content as you like.
<br>
Giving your links descriptions is easy too. 
Put a bar ('|') between the description and the pseudo file name.
Thus [~hello how are you|greeting] and [~howdie|greeting] become [hello how are you|greeting] and [howdie|greeting]. <br>
<br>
If you want a [~section in square brackets] to not be translated,
put a ~ (tilde) inside the left open square brace like so [~ <br>
<br>
<h3>Suport for other HTML features</h3>
Tables, indented sections, preformated sections headings and embedded images are all possible.
Your HTML editor probably has the menu options to effect them built in.
For images, wrap around text looks nice.
Images will be copied to the Cozmos server from any location (local file system or another website).<br>
