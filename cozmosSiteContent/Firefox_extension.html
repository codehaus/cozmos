This extension for Firefox adds an 'Edit' menu option to the 'File'
menu and maps Ctrl-E (or Apple-E) to it so that it can be launched from
a keystroke.<br>
<br>
When invoked, DreamWeaver 8 or SeaMonkey's Composer (by the Mozilla
Foundation) will launch for the page in question.&nbsp; You should
install them first.<br>
<br>
From there edits can be performed and the page pushed back by the
publish mechanism.<br>
<br>
Here is version 0.9 of the firefox plugin.&nbsp; <a

<br>
The extension is not yet fully configurable. It looks for predictable
locations for the executables withing the OS in question.<br>
