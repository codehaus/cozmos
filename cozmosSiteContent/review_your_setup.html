<h2>Viewing Cozmos pages</h2>
Use any Web Browser on any Operating system.&nbsp; <br>
<h2>Editing Pages in a Cozmos system using SeaMonkey<br>
</h2>
For now (early 2007) you can only* use an application called SeaMonkey
from the Mozilla Foundation (the same people that make Firefox).&nbsp;
And even having limited editing to one application, you have to modify
it slightly after installation.<br>
<br>
1) Go get SeaMonkey from <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/</a>
(any recent version).<br>
<br>
2) Install it the normal way.<br>
<br>
3) Go to to a directory called 'chrome' that contains a file called
'comm.jar' in a command shell<br>
<br>
4) Do jar -xf comm.jar content/editor/editorApplicationOverlay.js <br>
<br>
5) Edit that file<br>
<br>
6) Change ....<br>
<pre>&nbsp; function editPage(url, launchWindow, delay)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; // Always strip off "view-source:" and #anchors<br>&nbsp; url = url.replace(/^view-source:/, "").replace(/#.*/, "");</pre>
&nbsp; to ....<br>
<pre>&nbsp; function editPage(url, launchWindow, delay)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; // Always strip off "view-source:" and #anchors<br>&nbsp; url = url.replace(/^view-source:/, "").replace(/#.*/, "");<br>&nbsp; if (url.substr(0,4) == "http")<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (url.indexOf("?") &gt; 0)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url = url + "&amp;editMode=true";&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url = url + "?editMode=true";&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; }</pre>
7) Do jar -uf comm.jar content/editor/editorApplicationOverlay.js<br>
<br>
Now your SeaMonkey has been modified. It allows the server side Cozmos
to recognise the differences betweeen a page request from the browser
and one from the composer (editor) sides of SeaMonkey.&nbsp; We hope to
see the SeaMonkey team build in such functionality in future.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that there are no permissions presently for
editing of pages.&nbsp; This will change in future versions of Cozmos.<br>
<br>
We will also supply a script to modify SeaMonkey for you in future
versions.<br>
<br>
8) On any page you want to edit, while in SeaMonkey, choose 'Edit' from
the 'File' menu. Alternatively, press Ctrl-E or Apple-E (Windows/Linux
vs Mac).&nbsp; When your finished editing, hit the publishbutton in the
toolbar to push the changes back.<br>
<h2>Editing Pages in a Cozmos system using other browsers<br>
</h2>
In time we hope that Firefox gets a full and pluggable HTML editing
component, and that Internet Explorer gets a clean one (Word is not
quite good enough).&nbsp; For Safari (Mac) Konqueror (Linux) and others
changes will similarly need to be made to be fully editable-with-WebDAV
compatible.&nbsp; As of early 2007, none of these browsers are
compatible.<br>
