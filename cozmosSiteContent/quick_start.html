<h1>Quick Start</h1>
Wanting to mount your own server ?&nbsp; Read on.<br>
<br>
Wanting to edit pages in a pre-exiting Cozmos server ? Read [review
your setup]<br>
<br>
You should be able to install the Java Development Kit and Java web
containers as well as modestly configure mod_dav_svn.<br>
<br>
Its best to use a version of Linux that has Apache pre-installed and
mod_sav_svn installed giving a working https capability for regular
Subversion.<br>
<h2>Install the Cozmos web app into Apache's Tomcat server</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alpha verions</span> of
Cozmos available here <a
 href="downloads/cozmos-standalone-SNAPSHOT.war">here</a> (for the
standalone version of Cozmos) and <a
 href="downloads/cozmos-depends-on-subversion-SNAPSHOT.war">here</a>
for the version that stores content in Subversion.&nbsp; Both of the
WAR files are pretty small. <br>
<br>
If you are using the standalone version and want to serve using
Mortbay's <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/">Jetty</a> web server, it
will work as well as Tomcat, but you
must&nbsp; have JETTY_HOME as an enviromental variable set in order for
the content to be stored
after the web server is bought down.<br>
<br>
If you are using the Subversion depending version, you need to work on
the
web.xml in WEB-INF inside the WAR file.&nbsp; There's a URL there (that
must end in a slash) that points to the mod_dav_svn (https://) entry
point that you're planning to store content in.&nbsp; You will need to
push content into there before you launch the web container.&nbsp; You
will also need to have turned autorevisioning on for mod_dav_svn.<br>
<h2>For SeaMonkey editing, download and patch it <br>
</h2>
1) Go get a recent version of <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/">SeaMonkey</a><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you have to make a modification to SeaMonkey after
installing it.<br>
<br>
2) Install it the normal way.<br>
<br>
3) Go to to a directory called 'chrome' that contains a file called
'comm.jar' in a command shell<br>
<br>
4) Do jar -xf comm.jar content/editor/editorApplicationOverlay.js<br>
<br>
5) Edit that file in Notepad, Textpad, Vi, Emacs etc..<br>
<br>
6) Change ....<br>
<pre>&nbsp; function editPage(url, launchWindow, delay)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; // Always strip off "view-source:" and #anchors<br>&nbsp; url = url.replace(/^view-source:/, "").replace(/#.*/, "");</pre>
&nbsp; to ....<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp; function editPage(url, launchWindow, delay)<br>  {<br>&nbsp; // Always strip off "view-source:" and #anchors<br>&nbsp; url = url.replace(/^view-source:/, "").replace(/#.*/, "");<br>&nbsp; if (url.substr(0,4) == "http")<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (url.indexOf("?") &gt; 0)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url = url + "&amp;editMode=true";&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url = url + "?editMode=true";&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; }</pre>
<br>
7) Do jar -uf comm.jar content/editor/editorApplicationOverlay.js<br>
<br>
Now your SeaMonkey has been modified. It allows the server side Cozmos
to recognise the differences betweeen a page request from the browser
and one from the composer (editor) sides of SeaMonkey.&nbsp; We hope to
see the SeaMonkey team build in such functionality in future.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that there are no permissions presently for
editing of pages.&nbsp; This will change in future versions of Cozmos.<br>
<br>
We will supply a script to modify SeaMonkey for you in future versions.<br>
<h2>Edit a page on the site with MS Word</h2>
While browsing the Cozmos application site
(http://localhost:8080/cozmos?) with Internet Explorer,&nbsp; chose
"Edit page with Microsoft Word" from the File menu.&nbsp; This used to
be mapped to Ctrl-E (pity its not).&nbsp; When finished choose the
regular Save Icon.<br>
<h2>Edit a page on the site with SeaMonkey</h2>
While browsing the Cozmos application site
(http://localhost:8080/cozmos?) with SeaMonkey, hit Ctrl-E (Apple-E for
Mac users) and make changes to the page.&nbsp; Hit the "Publish"&nbsp;
icon in the toolbar to push the changes back to the server.<br>
